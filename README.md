# H3 Godot

Godot bindings for H3, a hierarchical hexagonal geospatial indexing system.

H3 is a geospatial indexing system using a hexagonal grid that can be (approximately) subdivided into finer and finer hexagonal grids, combining the benefits of a hexagonal grid with [S2](https://code.google.com/archive/p/s2-geometry-library/)'s hierarchical subdivisions.

Documentation is available at [https://h3geo.org/](https://h3geo.org/). Developer documentation in Markdown format is available under the [dev-docs](./dev-docs/) directory.
